# Front-end-baby-steps
 
 Second front-end evaluation, after 1 month of learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript

 Not much to say about javascript here, but I used this exercise to practice : 
 - Bootstrap
 - styles present in the "styles" folder were already implemented. Working with already existing code was a bit new
 - trying to use flex properties with bootstrap
